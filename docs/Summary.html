        The Doctrine Of Double Effect & Summary 
    </h2>
    <div>
        The doctrine of double effect explains that to do something bad or wrong we must have a second right or correct reason to do so, applying it to the issue of surveillance: we monitor our people to determine which are criminals to keep the people safe. That there is the thinking behind the use of surveillance on the public. The authorities believe that this allows them to do numerous things that can affect people in different ways is morally correct, the issues of surveillance have been listed above and analysed by four different ethical systems to determine their morality. The idea of surveillance to keep the public safe is morally correct but the way and problems of their methods is flawed and as such is morally wrong. But with societies ever advancing strides In the fields of science and engineering, come new ways of surveillance and new ways to justify it. The task of finding the terms of a moral justification for the act of surveillance is an unending task.
