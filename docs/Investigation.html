    <h2>What degree of surveillance can be introduced into a citizens life by the government in the interest of security of the country or state </h2>
    <div>
        The degree of surveillance can vary depending on the government or the reason, going as far as planting bugs, cameras and watching peoples browsers history requires a deep reason, it could be about drugs, illegal firearms or criminal espionage. Simply looking through one’s history can be used to determine their strengths, weaknesses and patterns that can be used against them if needed. Utilitarian standing is that stopping a massive drug cartel that could cause pain amongst police or family members of drug addicts, trying to stop them, drug addicts falling down a bigger hole and money used to stop or supply the drugs is the valid reason behind picking through a known drug dealer's life to its bone dry. The small insignificance of one's privacy being picked clean is better than wasting time, money and effort on stopping them through normal means of police work. The deontological standing is different from before as the universal law that is to be made varies depending on the crime, ie. Police can go as far as needed depending on the size or importance of the crime but has to be confirmed by a judge to make the surveillance appropriate to keep it as fair as humanly possible.this can be done but is incredibly tedious, and again there should be non opposition as even police want to save money and this is a way to know what the minimum amount of surveillance is needed when needed instead of overboarding because they don't know what or how much surveillance this is a more cost efficient way. The second part of deontological standing is to keep the surveillance as human as possible or as minimum as possible as overextending the amount of surveillance can be seen as treating the person as no longer a person with rights rather an animal being locked in a cage being constantly watched for their apparent safety. The world would probably be much better if this was applied to the economy. Consequeslism does say that the outcomes justified the means so going overboard is fine as long as the criminal is caught, this can lead to having minor criminals being watched by a pair of armed guards with body cams, cameras in walls and recording devices strapped to the criminal. This is rather counter productive as the criminal can tell if he or she is being watched and may not commit a crime, subsequently if he or she does commit a crime there will be a substantial amount of evidence to lock him or her in jail. Virtue however determines that if the person in charge of monitoring of a criminal has a chequered past and corrupt the person may go overboard and from his or her character and intentions we can see this as morally wrong, however if the person in charge knows the threat that the criminal may be he or she may go overboard in order to stop the criminal with good intentions, then we can see that as morally correct from a virtue view point. 
    </div>
      <h2>Class sorting</h2>
      <div>
        Another problem with surveillance is social sorting where a person or group is kept under surveillance because of his or her social status or race within a social society. This sorting happens across the world where in certain cases a young group of minority people are targeted to be under surveillance because of their race, this discrimination is more apparent among societies that allow for racism and bigotry towards ethnic groups of different race, gender and age. Utilitarianism indicates that if surveilling a minority group is for a greater good then it is morally correct but the outrage that the minority group and others linked to it could be more than the greater good. The deontological viewpoint is defined by the universal law that is applied, in this case: groups of minorities are to be treated equally and as such surveillance under discriminatory pretences are illegal. This would stop all surveillance that is targeted at minority groups and it will create equality in the legal system so that no person can be convicted or arrested due to discriminatory reasons or illegal surveillance because of their race, social status or gender. If someone does oppose this law can be considered a bigot and should be shunned from society, I kid of course but if they do oppose it would be for the reasons that they believe is illogical and discriminatory, such as “they are a minority who cares' '. The implementation of the law is a great way to deal with the law unfairly convicting innocent people because of their race or gender through monitoring them and finding ridiculous minor crimes that they use to convict them such as accidentally putting glass in the plastic recycling bin. The second half of deontological reasoning is to treat others as equals and to remove monitoring people under false pretences or discrimination is a form of equality among the minority groups and majority groups. Consequentialism does however conflict with the idea of equality and that the ends justify the means would equate to groups of minority being monitored and having no reparation because of the ends, if they watch a certain group for years, and if just one person happened to steal an apple the operation of surveilling a minority group would be justified so in this instance this system is flawed. Virtue ethics determines that if the character of the minority group is wrong then surveillance is morally justified however if the person who ordered the surveillance on a person or group of minority is corrupt, discriminatory and a bigot then it would be morally wrong.

      <h2>Safety</h2>
      <div>Safety is often a common justification for the use of surveillance but it is a reason that many agree with. An example of surveillance being used for safety is the elderly, they often need assistance and when concerned about their safety they are often put under surveillance to make sure they are healthy and alive. From a utilitarianism view point keeping the elderly safe with surveillance is fine because the joy and relief that family members experience is a substantial amount more than the small expense of government funding that is used to keep them safe and healthy. Deontologists agree as creating a universal law of keeping elderly safe and healthy would have little disagreement, it won’t be using people as a means as if they voluntarily agree that a small part of their tax is used to keep nursing homes active and in return the elderly safe. Consequentialism also abides with the idea of keeping the elderly safe and healthy through surveillance is acceptable and that intruding on their privacy is greater than the safety of their lives. Virtue ethics is different as if the government agrees to use a small amount of taxes to surveil the elderly for their safety is doing it out of genuine care for the elderly and not because the public demand it to happen than it it is morally right but if they are doing it to keep the public happy the morality is tainted and is rendered wrong. 

      </div>
        <h2>Exploitation</h2>
        <div>Exploitation is deeply tethered to the act of surveillance, with many people being exploited or blackmailed because of an illegal act or incident that was being monitored or recorded by a person. These can be exploited for personal gain or for money and power, these favours that can be called upon whenever as long as the person has the evidence of the act or incident. With utilitarianism, if exploiting is for the greater good and people it can be viewed as morally right but if the exploiter is doing it for personal gain and is endangering a mass of people it is viewed as morally wrong. A deontologist may answer this issue differently as setting a universal law on exploitation is much harder, ie. Exploitation is illegal unless it is in the interests of the country or state for its protection and safety. This can be enforced and implemented and kept track of to make sure Consequalism however is much like utilitarianism as if the outcome is good and keeps people safe, exploitation can be used to any means as long as the outcome can justify the means. Virtue ethics determine that exploiting if the character is “good” and has good intentions behind the exploitation then it can be defined as morally good or right, however when the person who is exploiting that is corrupt and is exploiting for personal gain is considered as morally wrong or bad.
        </div>
        <h2>Fixing the issue</h2>
        <div>
            Fixing the issue of surveillance is difficult because there will always be someone doing it for self gain or corrupt reasons. To ensure that the corruption and self gain is minimised we cannot trust the government to do the surveillance, the system of surveillance can be changed to have a certain group of people that are known for not being corruptible and as self righteous as possible. These people can be selected by the public so there is a small part of democracy in the process. This group of selected people must ask for permission from the people that are being monitored so they have consent. These are universal laws that could be implemented however there will still be people who monitor illegally and for wrong reasons this is the extent we can go to ensure safety, privacy and trust.
