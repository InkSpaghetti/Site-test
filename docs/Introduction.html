    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>
        
        The ethics of surveillance is a deep rabbit hole, ranging from surveilling criminals to parents reading their children's diaries. The question regarding the morality of surveillance has many interpretations, as different perspectives can change the outcome of the question. To answer the question of the ethics of surveillance, we must zoom into a specific aspect and remain unbiased as to ensure the validity of the analysis. The question is, â€œIs motive more important than consequences?"
A question like this one is hard to answer as many consequences can arise from a singular motive. In this case we will use surveillance as an example. The consequences of surveillance are often reduced privacy, broken trust and exploitation. Furthermore motives could range from national security, safety, racism, social sorting and tyranny. 

These are completely different motives, with some having justifiable arguments and some being ethically murky. If the safety of a country depends on a person's privacy being removed, is it right to remove the right to privacy? Is it our duty to protect our country or to protect our rights? These questions reflect human autonomy and freedom and the issues that arise when these rights are challenged. The dilemmas of surveillance are vast and here I will apply four different ethical theories to determine their moral standing point. 

    </div>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <div>The four moral theories I will apply are utilitarian, deontological, consequentialism and virtue ethics. Utilitarianism is a theory that prescribes actions that maximise happiness and well-being for all affected individuals. 
        Deontology is an ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of universal laws that you would make and justify it through four steps.
        The four steps are as follows; 1 can the law physically exist, 2 can the law be applied realistically, 3 would there be opposition to the law, 4 can the world exist without the law. 
        Deontology focuses on the answers to these steps rather than the consequences of the action. 
        Consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgement about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act is one that will produce a good outcome. Virtue ethicists discuss the nature and definition of virtues and other related problems that focus on the consequences of action. 
      </div>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <div>From a utilitarian viewpoint surveilling the populace is the correct option as the safety of the general public is greater than the privacy of one person or the many. A deontological standing is that we must first create a universal law that includes the key idea of privacy within surveillance, privacy can be removed if necessary in the case of national security and defence. This law can be enforced and done, only installing cameras when needed so this law is enforceable, the third step should be to know if there is any opposition against the law. The world could exist in this state following the four steps of deontology. Consequentialism dictates that the morality of surveillance is based on the outcome or consequences that arise at the cost of privacy over protection. Consequentialism would say that the issue of privacy that surveillance removes, is rendered moot because of the probable outcome. However virtue ethics determine that the morality is based on the characteristics of the person surveilling, if the watcher is corrupt and being payed to watch a specific person or group the outcome or morality is wrong or bad but if the watcher is incorruptible and is doing the surveilling for the protection of the people it can be considered as right or wrong. The privacy issue is murky as even invading the privacy of the people is for the greater good it still breaks laws and the trust of the people they survey. 
      </div>
        <h2>Broken Trust</h2>
        <div>Monitoring people without their permission suggests a lack of trust in the person that is being monitored. We watch children initially for their safety, but increasingly as they age to ensure that they interact well with others. Part of the learning process involves what is acceptable behaviour and this is reinforced as adults reward accordingly, when this surveillance continues after childhood, although there can be both an lasting effect of being treated as a child and can be associated with lack of trust. The sense or knowledge of being monitored can have lasting effects on the public as many may avoid doing activities under the pretence that they are being watched. This lingering effect of qualm will also raise suspicion on why the government or monarchy are monitoring the people, is it because of spies? Or is it about quashing individuals that don't approve of the government or monarchies approaches to certain subjects. Certain ideas may form regarding the integrity of the leading power and asking themselves if the government system or monarchy is so trustworthy and strong why the monitoring, is there something they are hiding? These questions create doubt and fear in the minds of the people and can lead to rebellions against the authorities. 
        </div>
        <h2>Permission</h2>
        <div>
        Permission is another key issue regarding surveillance, often governments conduct surveillance without consent or permission from the people. When objections are raised against the idea and use of surveillance it is in cases where the person or group is put under surveillance did not and would not consent to being monitored. But in spite of that, patients under surveillance by nurses and doctors or students in school do not seem to be controversial because when entering a hospital or school the person or parent allows for the teachers or doctors to monitor them for their safety or health. Utilitarianism would argue that monitoring the health and safety of a patient that could hurt or harm others is better than not doing so due to not having permission. A deontological viewpoint is that with applying a universal law is that all surveillance must have consent of the people that are being monitored. This is something that can be achieved easily as this ties in with the issue of privacy, this law can be enforced by legal systems. The only people who would oppose it are people who want to monitor people without them knowing, usually for corrupt purposes. We are also treating the monitored as equals and justifying it as correct. With the ever increasing amount of surveillance many, more and more people would know that they are being watched so an increasing amount of people would want to. Applying the four steps here is simple, is it possible to ask for permission before monitoring is easy enough, to enforce this law could stand an issue as when asking criminals for permission they often reject the idea or the premise entirely. Opposition would consist of possibly police as warning criminals that they are under surveillance would deter them from doing criminal activities. Consequentialism regards that the outcome of being asked for permission changes as some of the people may agree and not feel the need to hide or not do something because of the chance of being monitored, they know that they are being monitored and as such agreed that they will have their actions recorded and watched, while a person who does not agree to be monitored will feel safer knowing they cannot watch them without consent and will be able to freely do their activities. As such consequentialism will agree that with consent surveillance is acceptable and morally right. Virtue ethics however is grey as maybe the monitor asking for permission has a different reason behind monitoring besides their original reasons, or the person being watched allows for monitoring but does not agree with the idea and only doing so because they know it's for a greater good. They know that the premise behind the surveillance is right but they would prefer it was not them being monitored. There is no correct answer with virtue as it depends on the character of both the monitor and the person being monitored.
